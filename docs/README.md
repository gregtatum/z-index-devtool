# Docs

This folder contains documentation for the project and test code, but not the end project
code.

# The Stacking Context

Patrick Brosset provided an initial stacking context utility to provide the graph of
stacking contexts. It is located in [stacking-context.js](./stacking-context.js) and
will be a useful starting point for this project.

# Z-Index Sandbox Examples

The [sandbox](./sandbox) folder contains examples of z-index issues and uses. It has
potential problems that the user will want to be able to fix, and provides a good base
of examples for problems this tool will want to solve.
